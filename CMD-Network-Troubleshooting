You can check your network information using ipconfig. The terminal output below shows our IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.

You can also use ipconfig /all for more information about your network configuration. As shown in the terminal below, we can view our DNS servers and confirm that DHCP is enabled.

Another valuable tool for troubleshooting is tracert, which stands for trace route. The command tracert target_name traces the network route traversed to reach the target. 
Without getting into more details, it expects the routers on the path to notify us if they drop a packet because its time-to-live (TTL) has reached zero. 
The terminal output below shows that we passed through 15 routers before reaching our target.

One networking command worth knowing is nslookup. It looks up a host or domain and returns its IP address. The syntax nslookup example.com

This command displays current network connections and listening ports. A basic netstat

If you are curious about the other options, you can run netstat -h, where -h displays the help page. We opted for the following options:

    -a displays all established connections and listening ports
    -b shows the program associated with each listening port and established connection
    -o reveals the process ID (PID) associated with the connection
    -n uses a numerical form for addresses and port numbers
