Working With Directories

You can use cd without parameters to display the current drive and directory. It is the equivalent of asking the system, where am I?

You can view the child directories using dir.

Note that you can use the following options with dir:

    dir /a - Displays hidden and system files as well.
    dir /s - Displays files in the current directory and all subdirectories.

You can type tree to visually represent the child directories and subdirectories.

You can change to any directory by using the command cd target_directory; this is equivalent to double-clicking the target_directory on your desktop. Furthermore, you can use cd .. to go up one level. An example is shown in the terminal output below.

To create a directory, use mkdir directory_name; mkdir stands for make directory. To delete a directory, use rmdir directory_name; rmdir stands for remove directory. The terminal output below shows creating and deleting a directory.

delete a file using del or erase.

use the wildcard character * to refer to multiple files. For example, copy *.md C:\Markdown will copy all files with the extension md to the directory C:\Markdown.
